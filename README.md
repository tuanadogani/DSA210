# Analysis of Daily Activity Patterns


Code related to my project can be found in

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing my daily activity data to uncover patterns in physical activity and mood. The main goal is to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing my daily routine. Various data sets gathered from my own track book and Apple health app will be analysed in order to detect if there is a relation between my mood evaluation of day and the activities I am engaged during the day. 

## Motivation 
I want to increase the quality of my daily routine by considering the impacts of several factors which effect my mood, since my mood is a decisive factor of my efficiency. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about my daily activities and feelings over the last two months. It includes:

- *Rate of Day*: The evaluation of the day's mood. I have a track book that I evaluate my daily mood, anxiety level and sleep hours. 
- *Sleep Hours*: Duration and time of sleep. Will be gathered from my track book.
- *Anxiety Level*: The level of anxiety experienced during the day. Will be gathered from my track book. 
- *Physical Activity*: Step Count per day. Apple Health App will be the provider of this data.

  ## Project Plan

  - Data cleaning
  - Corelation analysis and visualisation
  - Examining trends if exists
  - conclusion comments and hypotesis re-evaluation

## Techniques Used

-Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, etc., are often used to import and manipulate datasets.
-Files: CSV, Excel
-Cleaning: removing unnecessary columns.
-Visualization: Use of Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visual analysis.
-Descriptive Statistics: Calculating means, medians, standard deviations, correlations, etc.
-Hypothesis Testing: P-values.
-Correlation Analysis: Pearson or Spearman correlation.

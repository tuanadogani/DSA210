# Analysis of Daily Activity Patterns

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing my daily activity data to uncover patterns in physical activity and mood. The main goal is to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing my daily routine. Various data sets gathered from my own habit journal and Apple health app will be analysed in order to detect if there is a relation between my mood evaluation of day and the activities I am engaged during the day. 

## Motivation 
I want to increase the quality of my daily routine by considering the impacts of several factors which effect my mood, since my mood is a decisive factor of my efficiency. 

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about my daily activities and feelings over the last two months. It includes:
- *Date*: The specific day. 
- *Rate of Day*: The evaluation of the day's mood. I have a track book that I evaluate my daily mood, anxiety level and sleep hours. 
- *Sleep Hours*: Duration and time of sleep. Will be gathered from my track book.
- *Anxiety Level*: The level of anxiety experienced during the day. Will be gathered from my track book. 
- *Physical Activity*: Walking distance per day. Apple Health App will be the provider of this data.

  ## Points to be examined
  Direct Effects: Examining indıvıdual impacts identifies which variables have the strongest relationship with mood.
  
  Indirect Effects: Examining indirect impacts would show how for ex. anxiety interacts with other variables, enables us to gain more accurate sight by considering interactions.

  ## Project Plan

  - Formulation of my hypotesis
  - Corelation analysis and visualisation
  - Examining trends
  - Resulting most important correlations
  - conclusion comments and hypotesis re-evaluation 


  Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Longer sleep duration is positively correlated with a higher mood evaluation of the day.
  Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Increased walking distance during the day is positively correlated with a higher mood evaluation.
  Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher anxiety levels are negatively correlated with the mood evaluation of the day.
  Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Higher anxiety levels are negatively correlated with sleep duration.
  Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Longer sleep duration combined with higher physical activity is associated with the highest mood evaluations.
